> **Opens with RFID tags and Bluetooth signal via Android app. It has sound and
LED notifications. It is automatically closed thanks to the reed switch, which
> is activated by the counter bar of the lock with a magnet. The case and some
> components of the system were printed on a
3D-printer. Prototype:**
